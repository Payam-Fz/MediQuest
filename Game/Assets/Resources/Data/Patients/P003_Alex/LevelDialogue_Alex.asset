  - '$Player%Hi Alex, My name is Dr. Player  :''). and I will be doing your checkup
    today.

    $Player%I can see in your chart that you had a knee joint replacement
    surgery 2 days ago in this hospital. How are you feeling today? Happy with your
    new leg?!

    $Alex%Excited to try the new wheelchair, haha...My knee feels
    good, but I''m really tired! I think you should discharge me ASAP. Why are you
    keeping me here if I feel good?!

    $Player%We need more tests before we can
    let you go. So, let''s wait and I will come back with your results later. Okay?

    $Alex%I
    think there''s no other choice...'
